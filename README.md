# FreeRTOS Scheduler

Overview
In our project, we designed a software implementation of FreeRtos scheduler. Our main goal was
to coordinate between various tasks with different priorities including implementing Monotonic-
Rate scheduler statically and dynamically. Each task has its own arrival, computation and period
time, then we ensure that they are scheduled accordingly. This project helped us understand how
FreeRtos scheduler works and we gain more experience in Real-Time Embedded System Design.
